### Introduction‚úçÔ∏è

This is my Master's Dissertation project üéì which is in line with United Nations SDG Target 7.2 .........

I worked intensively on this project whose Aim is ***forecasting*** the future Renewable energy share of China, the U.S.A, Canada, India and Brazil countries üó∫Ô∏è using the publicly available dataset taken from the Our World in Data Website.

---
### Outcome of Project
- United Nations (UN) framed a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 and set a Target-7.2 to  increase the renewable energy share by the year 2030.
- This research aims to predict the renewable energy share of the top five renewable energy consumers in the present world and verify whether they are in line with the UN SDG target or not
---
### Methodology 
- Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- Auto ARIMA
- Facebook (FB) Prophet and
- Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) are the four-time series forecasting models used in this research to predict the future renewable energy share value.
  
  ---
### Few Insights
- The renewable energy share of China and the United States of America (U.S.A) is predicted to be increased by the year 2030 with a value of 20.43% and 13.75% respectively.
- Target 7.2 is just to  increase the percentage of share, but there is no specific percentage to achieve and it is observed that for the countries Brazil, Canada, and India the percentage of share is predicted to be decreased.

- The *directly* forecasted renewable energy share and *indirectly* calculated renewable energy share are almost same,which signifies the methodology adapted in this project gave accurate results, *however suggestions to improve the projects are welcome*.
